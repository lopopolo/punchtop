# cast-client

Crate `cast-client` provides a client for controlling media playback on a
Chromecast device. It supports launching the _Default Media Receiver_ app,
loading media, controlling media playback, and modifying device settings.

## Device Discovery

Chromecast devices are discoverable on the local network using mDNS and the
`_googlecast._tcp.local` service name. The connection information for a device
is given by a DNS `A` or `AAAA` record (IP) and `SRV` record (port), The device
name can be extracted from the `fn` field of the DNS `TXT` record.

## Cast Protocol

### Transport

Communication with the device happens over a long-lived TLS socket. Host name
and cert verification on this connection is optional for clients.

The cast protocol is a framed protocol. Each frame consists of a `u32`
length-prefixed [`CastMessage` protobuf](proto/cast_channel.proto#L11-L52). The
maximum size of the encoded protobuf for requests and responses is 64KB.

### Channels

The `CastMessage` protobuf is used to multiplex messages over several
communication channels which are identified by the `namespace` field in the
protobuf. The available namespaces are:

- `urn:x-cast:com.google.cast.tp.connection`
- `urn:x-cast:com.google.cast.tp.heartbeat`
- `urn:x-cast:com.google.cast.media`
- `urn:x-cast:com.google.cast.receiver`

JSON-encoded messages are passed to each channel via the `payload_utf8` field in
the protobuf.

JSON payloads for the media and receiver channels are identified by a unique
request ID. The `0` request ID is reserved for "spontaneous" messages from the
device. Request IDs may not be reused and should monotonically increase. When a
payload generates a response from the receiver, the same request ID will be
echoed back in the response.

#### connection

The connection channel is a transport channel used to manage connections to
receiver apps.

##### Messages

###### Connect

**Purpose**: Establish a connection to the device or a transport channel for a
launched app.

```json
{
  "type": "CONNECT",
  "userAgent": "cast-client v0.1.0"
}
```

##### Responses

###### Close

**Purpose**: Device has closed the connection.

The connection may be closed due to a protocol error or liveness timeout. It may
be necessary to send a `CONNECT` message to reestablish the connection.

```json
{
  "type": "CLOSE"
}
```

#### heartbeat

The heartbeat channel is a transport channel used by the device and the client
for keepalive messages.

##### Messages

###### Ping

**Purpose**: Send a liveness challenge to the device.

A `PING` should be sent to the device on a regular interval. `cast-client` sends
a `PING` every 5 seconds.

```json
{
  "type": "PING"
}
```

###### Pong

**Purpose**: Acknowledge a liveness challenge from the device.

```json
{
  "type": "PONG"
}

##### Responses

###### Ping

**Purpose**: A liveness challenge from the device.

Should respond to the device with a `PONG` message.

```json
{
  "type": "PING"
}
```

###### Pong

**Purpose**: A liveness acknowledgement from the device.

No special handling is required.

```json
{
  "type": "PONG"
}
```

#### media

The media channel is used to control media playback.

The `customData` field on some messages is an optional JSON object that may be
interpreted by a custom
[receiver application](https://developers.google.com/cast/v2/receiver_apps).

`requestId` and `mediaSessionId` are `u64` fields.

##### Messages

}
```

### Cast Transport and Session

Upon connecting to the device, senders must initiate connections with the apps
they launch. For messages targeted at a launched app, the `transportId` of the
app is the `destination` field in the `CastMessage`.

Commands on the media channel are associated with a particular instance of an
app or loaded media. For `LOAD` commands, the `sessionId` field in the JSON
payload is the `sessionId` associated with the launched app. For all other
commands, the `sessionId` field in the JSON payload is the `mediaSessionId`
returned from the `LOAD` command.

### Sender and Receiver Multiplexing

The cast protocol includes multiple concepts for multiplexing over the shared
TLS socket.

#### Source

Every `CastMessage` must send a `source` which specifies the sender (client) ID.
There is a special source for default senders, `sender-0`.

For all messages on all channels, it is sufficient to send the
`DEFAULT_SENDER_ID`.

#### Destination

Every `CastMessage` must set a `destination` which specifies the _target app_.
There is a special destination for messages directed at the receiver,
`receiver-0`.

- For messages on the connection channel, the `destination` is either the
  `DEFAULT_DESTINATION_ID` for initial connection or the `transportId` for a
  launched app.
- For messages on the heartbeat channel, the `destination` is the
  `DEFUALT_DESTINATION_ID`.
- For messages on the media channel, the `destination` is the `transportId` of
  the target launched app.
- For messages on the receiver channel, the `destination` is the
  `DEFUALT_DESTINATION_ID`.

## Streaming Media to a Device

The `LOAD` command on the media channel loads a media by URL. In order to serve
media to a Chromecast device, the device must be able to stream it. When
attempting to play local media (i.e. a song or video on disk), the sender must
make it accessible to the device by running an embedded media server.

Make each item in the playlist accessible via a unique URL. This URL only needs
to be stable during playback of the item.

### Supported Media Formats

<https://developers.google.com/cast/docs/media>

Chromecasts support a variety of media formats. If attempting to play media in a
format the device does not support, the sender can transcode on-the-fly to a
format supported by the device and make the transcode available via the embedded
media server.
