# stream-util

This crate provides mechanisms for canceling a [`Stream`](https://docs.rs/futures/0.1/futures/stream/trait.Stream.html)
and draining an [`UnboundedReceiver`](https://docs.rs/futures/0.1/futures/sync/mpsc/struct.UnboundedReceiver.html).

## Usage

To use this crate, add stream-util as a dependency to your project's Cargo.toml:

```toml
[dependencies]
stream-util = { git = "https://github.com/lopopolo/punchtop" }
```

## Drain

The extension trait `Drainable` provides a new `UnboundedReceiver` combinator,
`drain`. `Drain` yields elements from the underlying channel until the provided
`Future` resolves. It then closes the receiver and continues to yield the
remaining elements in the channel until it is empty.

## Cancel

The extension trait `Cancelable` provides a new `Stream` combinator, `cancel`.
`Cancel` yields elements from the underlying `Stream` until the provided `Future`
resolves. It then short circuits the underlying stream by returning
`Async::Ready(None)`, which stops polling of the underlying `Stream`.

## Trigger

stream-util provides a `trigger` function which returns `(Trigger, Valve)` as a
convenience for generating a `Future` for the combinators that resolves on
demand.

## Example: Cancel an Interval

The following code creates an infinite stream from a tokio `Interval` and cancels
it once 1 second has elapsed.

```rust
use std::thread;
use std::time::Duration;
use futures::Future;
use stream_util::{valve, Cancelable};
use tokio::timer::Interval;

let (trigger, valve) = valve();
let interval = thread::spawn(move || {
    let task = Interval::new_interval(Duration::from_millis(250))
        .cancel(valve)
        .for_each(|_| Ok(()))
        .map_err(|e| eprintln!("interval failed: {:?}", e));
    // start send-receive channel
    tokio::run(task);
});

// The interval thread will normally never exit, since the interval is repeats
// forever. With a `Cancel` we can short circuit the stream.
trigger.terminate();
interval.join().unwrap();
```

## Example: Drain a Channel

The following code creates an unbounded mpsc channel and drains two messages from
the channel after it has been canceled.

```rust
use std::thread;
use futures::Future;
use stream_util::{valve, Drainable};
use futures::sync::mpsc;

let (trigger, valve) = valve();
let (sender, receiver) = mpsc::unbounded::<()>();

sender.unbounded_send(()).unwrap();
sender.unbounded_send(()).unwrap();

// Trigger the drain before the channel starts consuming messages. Expect all
// existing messages to be drained from the channel.
trigger.terminate();
let chan = thread::spawn(move || {
    let task = receiver
        .drain(valve)
        .for_each(move |_| {
            msg_counter.fetch_add(1, Ordering::SeqCst);
            Ok(())
        })
        .map_err(|e| eprintln!("receive failed: {:?}", e));
    // start send-receive channel
    tokio::run(task);
});

// The receiver thread will normally never exit, since the sender is open. With a
// `Drain` we can close the receiver and drain any messages still in the channel.
chan.join().unwrap();
```
