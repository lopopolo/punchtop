# punchtop

punchtop is an audio game that runs a power hour using music on the local file
system and streams to a Chromecast device.

## Game

A [power hour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_hour) is a (drinking) game.
During each 60-second round, a song is played. A change in music marks each new
round.

## Usage

To run punchtop, you must build it from source. Punchtop depends on:

- nightly rust, which you can install using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/)
- node
- yarn

After you have installed the build dependencies, you can launch punchtop with
debug logging via cargo:

```sh
RUST_BACKTRACE=1 RUST_LOG=cast-client=debug,punchtop=debug,rocket=info cargo run
```

or in a release build:

```sh
cargo build --release
RUST_LOG=info caffeinate -s ./target/release/punchtop-webview
```
